# work-day

In this project I made a calander-like application to help track the time of day and list things you need to do during that time. In this project I used jquery to help with DOM manipulation. There were a couple of issues that I ran into, the first was hooking up moment.js to my code. I was only able to get it to work in  script tag in my html and not in a seperate JS folder. The next big issue was my making my code DRY. I didnt find a good way, leaving a large IF statement, but was able to shorten some. Overall I learned more about DOM manipulation and local storage.


Used jquery
Used bootstrap for css formatting
